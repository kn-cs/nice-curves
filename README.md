## Assembly implementations of scalar multiplication on the Montgomery curves M4698 and M4058

The source code of this repository correspond to the work [Security and Efficiency Trade-offs for Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
at the 128-bit and 224-bit Security Levels](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1259), authored by [Kaushik Nath](kaushikn_r@isical.ac.in) & [Palash Sarkar](palash@isical.ac.in) of [Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, India](https://www.isical.ac.in),
containing various assembly implementations of scalar multiplication on the Montgomery curves M4058 and M4698. 
The implementations of Montgomery ladder are developed targeting the modern Intel architectures like Skylake and Haswell.

To report a bug or make a comment regarding the implementations please drop a mail to: [Kaushik Nath](kaushikn_r@isical.ac.in).
